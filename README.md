My custom Vivaldi themes.

Checkout some of my previous projects with Vivaldi [Material Theme][material-theme] and [Windows Theme][windows-theme]. I will have those themes [here][vivaldi-themes] too.

## About

I will be adding a link to a current project I'm working on that creates Vivaldi themes. Most of the themes found here and below are generated from this project.
